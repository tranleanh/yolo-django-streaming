## 1. Steps to use
1. Download file "yolov3_coco.pb" from the link below and locate it in folder "yolov3_weight": ([gotolink](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1apB-yPIxxzC9D6_iAaQrXWuGpbWIK6Lp))
```bashrc
https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1apB-yPIxxzC9D6_iAaQrXWuGpbWIK6Lp
```
2. Create your virtual environment and install required packages: 
```bashrc
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run program: 
```bashrc
$ python manage.py runserver
```
4. Open any web browser and navigate to URL (home page): 
```bashrc
http://127.0.0.1:8000/index
```
## 2. What should happen then?
(don't worry, my face will not be on your screen)
- Camera 1:

- Camera 2:

![picture](images/cam2.png)

## 3. Be careful
- The 2 camera ids in the source code are "0" and "2" (for my computer). 
- You should change them for running on any other computers. Go to webcam/views.py then find and change "cam_id" parameter.
